                        Every car wash can benefit from a well-managed
                        membership program. Benefits include a stronger and
                        continuous flow of revenue, higher customer lifetime
                        value, more efficient operations, a more engaged
                        workforce, and higher profits. The key to success,
                        however, is that the program must be “well-managed,”
                        encompassing the Total Membership Lifecycle, rather than
                        just a promotional band-aid to a poor-performing
                        operation. While a commitment to a comprehensive
                        membership program can seem overwhelming to an-already
                        busy wash operator, EverWash experts bring the
                        management experience to contribute as a partner to
                        ensure membership success.

                        EverWash’s membership programs are custom-fit to grow
                        recurring revenue for any type of wash – tunnel express,
                        full-service, in-bay automatic, or self-serve. Whether a
                        wash has a current membership program, an
                        under-performing one, or no program at all, EverWash is
                        the answer.
