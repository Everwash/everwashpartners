We’re introducing a helpful update to the EverWash App that will enhance both your team’s efficiency and member satisfaction: the **“One-Time Password”** reset feature.

### How It Works:

When a member forgets their password, they can now select “Need a one-time password?” from the login screen. After entering their email or phone number, they’ll receive a 6-digit code that provides one-time access to the app. They can then choose to reset their password or continue using the one-time password option.

### Benefits to Your Wash and Members:

* **Fewer Support Calls**: Members can self-manage their logins, reducing inquiries and support time.
* **Streamlined Process for Attendants**: Your team can help members quickly by directing them to this new feature, minimizing disruptions to service.
* **Improved Member Satisfaction**: Fast, reliable access means a smoother experience for everyone.

We hope this update improves the experience for you, your team, and your members. Please email [AccountManagment@everwashpartners.com](mailto:AccountManagment@everwashpartners.com) with any questions.
