Philadelphia, PA — EverWash, the leading car wash membership platform, announced several key updates to its executive leadership team as the company continues to scale its operations and deliver innovative membership and revenue-driving solutions for car wash operators.

Jim Lutz has officially joined EverWash as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in a full-time capacity. Lutz, who began working with EverWash in late 2024 as a part-time advisor, brings deep financial leadership experience to the company. In his role, he will oversee all financial strategy and planning, guiding the company through its next stage of growth. Jim holds degrees from Penn State and Carnegie Mellon, and previously worked at GeoBlue, Qlik, and IBM. He resides in Wyndmoor, PA, and enjoys cycling and skiing in his free time.

Chris Villella has been promoted to Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), expanding his leadership from his previous role as Vice President of Business Development. Villella, who joined EverWash in 2022, will now lead the Sales, Marketing, and Account Management departments, aligning the company’s go-to-market efforts under a unified strategy. Chris was educated at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and previously worked at The CEI Group. Chris is Pittsburgh proud, but currently lives in Bucks County, PA.

Max Pulcini has been named Vice President of Marketing, stepping up from his previous role as Senior Director of Marketing & Communications. A longtime member of the EverWash team, Pulcini has been with the company since 2017 and will continue to lead communications, content, and lead generation initiatives. Max lives in Philadelphia and can often be found tailgating at local sporting events.

“These leadership updates reflect our commitment to building a world-class team to support EverWash’s continued momentum,” said Scott Caplan, Founder and CEO of EverWash. “Jim, Chris, and Max have each played critical roles in our success, and I’m confident they’ll help us drive even greater value for our partners, members, and employees moving forward.”
