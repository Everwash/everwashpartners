**September 11, 2025** — CryptoPay customers can now sign up for the Coinless mobile payment and loyalty app directly from the MyCryptoPay Control Panel, streamlining access to mobile payments, customer engagement tools, and digital wash club programs — all without the need for new hardware.

To get started, customers simply log into their MyCryptopay Control Panel and click the new Coinless Mobile App icon, or select the Coinless sign-up ad in the “Featured” section on the right-hand side. Both options direct users to a short WorldPay web form. Once the form is submitted, Coinless will handle the rest.

Enjoy seamless transaction visibility through Worldpay, viewing all onsite and in-app payments in your existing Worldpay IQ portal without additional systems or steps.

“This is all about giving operators tools that work right out of the box — without any added friction,” said Scott Caplan, CEO of Coinless. “With just a few clicks, CryptoPay customers can bring mobile convenience, loyalty features, and digital engagement to their washes — no new equipment needed.”

“CryptoPay is dedicated to providing car wash operators with flexibility and choices in how to use the CryptoPay system in their car washes for building customer loyalty. We feel this will be a great value to the car wash owner,” Dave Richards, VP of CryptoPay.

With Coinless, operators can:

* **Accept Mobile Payments** – Let customers pay directly through the Coinless app
* **Launch Loyalty & Wash Club Programs** – Drive repeat business with in-app credits and offers
* **Engage Customers Digitally** – Send targeted promotions, reminders, and updates

This streamlined sign-up experience is part of Coinless and CryptoPay’s shared mission to provide simple, effective, and accessible technology to IBA and self-serve car wash operators.
