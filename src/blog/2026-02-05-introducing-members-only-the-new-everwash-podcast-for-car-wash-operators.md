At EverWash, we spend a lot of time talking with car wash operators about memberships, staffing, churn, growth, technology, and what it really takes to run a profitable wash in today’s market.

That’s why we’re excited to officially launch Members Only: The EverWash Podcast—a new monthly podcast built specifically for car wash owners, operators, and industry professionals who want practical insight without the fluff.

### What Members Only Is All About

Members Only is hosted by Max Pulcini and Chris Villella, and it’s designed to be an operator-first conversation around membership, growth, and what actually works in the car wash business.

Each episode blends:

* *Real conversations with operators and industry leaders*
* *Practical insights around building and scaling membership programs*
* *Timely industry updates and EverWash news*
* *A little off-topic banter*

The goal is simple: create a space where operators can hear from people who understand the day-to-day realities of running a wash—and walk away with ideas they can actually use.

### Episode 1: A Conversation with EverWash Founder & CEO Scott Caplan

For our very first episode, we sat down with Scott Caplan, Founder & CEO of EverWash. But this conversation goes beyond the typical “founder interview.”

In addition to leading EverWash, Scott is also a car wash owner himself, operating EverWash Unlimited in Conshohocken, PA, and recently expanding with a second location. That hands-on ownership experience has given him a new perspective on membership, operations, and the challenges operators face every day.

In Episode 1, we cover:

* *Scott’s background in the gym industry and how it shaped his approach to recurring revenue*
* *What surprised him most after becoming a car wash owner*
* *What’s harder—and what feels familiar—about operating a wash*
* *And much more*

It’s a grounded, candid conversation that sets the tone for what Members Only will be moving forward.
