At EverWash, we spend a lot of time talking with car wash operators about memberships, staffing, churn, growth, technology, and what it really takes to run a profitable wash in today’s market.

That’s why we’re excited to officially launch Members Only: The EverWash Podcast—a new monthly podcast built specifically for car wash owners, operators, and industry professionals who want practical insight without the fluff.



What Members Only Is All About



Members Only is hosted by Max Pulcini and Chris Villella, and it’s designed to be an operator-first conversation around membership, growth, and what actually works in the car wash business.



Each episode blends:



* Real conversations with operators and industry leaders
* Practical insights around building and scaling membership programs
* Timely industry updates and EverWash news
* A little off-topic banter

The goal is simple: create a space where operators can hear from people who understand the day-to-day realities of running a wash—and walk away with ideas they can actually use.



Episode 1: A Conversation with EverWash Founder & CEO Scott Caplan



For our very first episode, we sat down with Scott Caplan, Founder & CEO of EverWash. But this conversation goes beyond the typical “founder interview.”



In addition to leading EverWash, Scott is also a car wash owner himself, operating EverWash Unlimited in Conshohocken, PA, and recently expanding with a second location. That hands-on ownership experience has given him a new perspective on membership, operations, and the challenges operators face every day.



In Episode 1, we cover:



* Scott’s background in the gym industry and how it shaped his approach to recurring revenue
* What surprised him most after becoming a car wash owner
* What’s harder—and what feels familiar—about operating a wash
* And much more

It’s a grounded, candid conversation that sets the tone for what Members Only will be moving forward.

Episode 1 of Members Only: The EverWash Podcast is available now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube.
